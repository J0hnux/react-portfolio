      "Clark Cars is a car rental website developed using NextJS and ReactJS. To style the website a combination of Tailwind and SCSS were used. Clark Cars is almost a complete website, with about and contact page that utilises the power of captcha to distinguish bots from humans. However, the captcha is very simple which asks a random mathematical question that even a kindergarten student can answer.",
