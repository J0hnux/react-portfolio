    description:
      "Clark Cars is a car rental website developed using NextJS and ReactJS. To style the website a combination of Tailwind and SCSS were used. Clark Cars is like almost any car rental websites out there, with a contact page that utilises the power of captcha to distinguish bots from humans. What I like most about the contact page is the captcha where I created all the mathematical questions with Paint with questions that even a kindergarten student can answer. The only thing that Clark Cars doesn't have yet is a fleet of cars that can actually be rented.",
